# Dragon Fighter: Egg Spell Forge - Combined Prototype GDD

## Pitch

**Dragon Fighter: Egg Spell Forge** is a funny casual 1v1 dragon duel where the player prepares a small set of custom dragon-egg spells, then casts them in battle with full spoken command words or fallback buttons. The game combines immediate voice-command combat with light spellcraft: each prepared egg spell has a type, name, energy cost, cooldown, and temporary dragon effect.

The prototype tests whether short spoken commands, readable cooldowns, and custom egg-spell loadouts can create a playful, fast, and understandable dragon battle for casual mobile players.

## Design Pillars

### 1. Voice First, Not Voice Only
The main fantasy is commanding a dragon out loud. The game should clearly show what word or spell name was recognized and what action triggered. Desktop and mobile fallback inputs are allowed so the prototype can still be tested when voice input is unavailable.

### 2. Spellcraft Creates Identity
Before combat, the player builds a small loadout of dragon-egg spells. Pattern complexity, spell type, and spell name give each player a sense of ownership without adding a full collection or progression system.

### 3. Funny and Immediate
Every successful cast should create a clear, exaggerated reaction: a dragon pose, egg crack, projectile, shield burst, hit flash, state label, sound cue, cooldown change, or silly visual flourish. The game should feel playful rather than serious.

### 4. Combat Decisions Over Movement
The player does not need advanced movement, aiming, or positioning skill. The prototype may allow simple tap, swipe, click, or lane dodge inputs, but the core challenge is choosing the right command or spell at the right time.

### 5. Small, Readable Battle System
Only a few actions and spells are available. HP, energy, cooldowns, state labels, recognized commands, and match status must always be visible so a new player can understand what is happening without explanation.

## Core Mechanic

During preparation, the player creates or receives five dragon-egg spells. Each spell has:

- A visual egg pattern.
- A spell type: **Attack**, **Defense**, **Support**, **Control**, or **Utility**.
- A unique spoken spell name.
- An energy cost based on pattern complexity.
- A cooldown.
- A temporary dragon effect in combat.

During combat, the player casts a prepared spell by saying its full spell name or pressing its spell button. Voice casting is fastest and uses the normal cooldown. Button casting is reliable but applies a longer cooldown.

When cast, the egg cracks open and summons a temporary dragon effect based on its type and pattern quality.

## Prototype Command Set

The prototype supports two layers of voice input:

### Basic Combat Commands

- **Attack**
- **Defence**
- **Block**
- **Skill**

These are default commands available for quick testing and tutorial-style play.

### Prepared Spell Names

The player also brings exactly five named egg spells into combat. Example names:

- **Long Fire**
- **Son Guard**
- **Thuy Heal**
- **Giong Snare**
- **Truc Dash**

A command or spell succeeds only if:

1. The full valid word or spell name is recognized.
2. The action or spell is not on cooldown.
3. The player has enough energy if casting a spell.
4. The player's dragon is not defeated.
5. The match is currently active.

When a command fails, the game displays the reason: **Unknown Command**, **Cooldown**, **Not Enough Energy**, **Voice Retry**, or **Defeated**.

## Core Loop

1. Create, choose, or randomly generate five dragon-egg spell patterns.
2. Assign each spell a type and spoken name.
3. Confirm the loadout.
4. Enter a 1v1 match after a 3-second countdown.
5. Regenerate energy over time.
6. Cast basic commands or prepared spells by voice or fallback button.
7. Watch HP, energy, cooldowns, active effects, and recognized commands update.
8. The AI opponent chooses actions and spells on its own schedule.
9. The loop continues until one side reaches 0 HP or the timer expires.
10. The result screen shows Win, Lose, or Draw, plus remaining HP, remaining energy, and most-used spell.
